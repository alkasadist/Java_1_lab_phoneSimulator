The following design patterns have been selected:

Creational Patterns:
    Multiton (for the Phone class)
        – to prevent the creation of phones with duplicate numbers.
    Singleton (for the PhoneCallMediator class)
        – to ensure all calls are handled through a single controller.
    Builder
    – to simplify phone creation using method chaining.

Structural Patterns:
    Facade
        – to simplify interaction between objects.
    Proxy (using the PhoneProxy class)
        – to separate error and exception handling logic.

Behavioral Patterns:
    Mediator (using the PhoneCallMediator class)
        – to manage calls between phones through a dedicated interface.
