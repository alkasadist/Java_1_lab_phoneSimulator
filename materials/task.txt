Build an object-oriented model of the subject domain based on your assigned variant.
Ensure the model can be extended with new types of objects and behaviors.
To support low coupling between modules and extensibility
of the software system, apply GoF design patterns.
You must use at least two patterns from each group: creational, structural, and behavioral.
Create a console application in Java that implements the designed object-oriented model.
It is recommended to coordinate all design decisions with the instructor in advance.

Variant 8:

Design an object-oriented model of a phone.

A phone has the following attributes:
    Phone number
    Balance

The phone supports the following operations:
    Make a call
    Answer a call
    End a call
    Replenish balance

The phone can be in the following states:
    Waiting
    Calling
    In call
    Blocked (balance is negative)

Implement an application that demonstrates the phone transitioning between these states.
